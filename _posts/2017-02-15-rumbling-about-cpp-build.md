This quote is from [Maven by Example](https://www.sonatype.com/ebooks) book, the sad thing about it, that it is still holds true for C++ in 2017:

> Before Maven provided a common interface for building software, every single project had someone dedicated
> to managing a fully customized build system. Developers had to take time away from developing
> software to learn about the idiosyncrasies of each new project they wanted to contribute to. In 2001,
> you’d have a completely different approach to building a project like Turbine than you would to building
> a project like Tomcat. If a new source code analysis tool came out that would perform static analysis on
> source code, or if someone developed a new unit testing framework, everybody would have to drop what
> they were doing and figure out how to fit it into each project’s custom build environment. How do you run
> unit tests? There were a thousand different answers. This environment was characterized by a thousand
> endless arguments about tools and build procedures. The age before Maven was an age of inefficiency,
> the age of the “Build Engineer”.
